### Abstract

This study employed a user-centered design approach to examine caregivers' understanding of and openness to AI-enhanced Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) systems. The goal was to understand the current state of AAC adoption and collaborate with families to envision AI features that can help bridge communication between caregivers and their loved ones. Our research aims to address parent-identified limitations in current AAC systems and provide a foundation for designing more effective, personalized communication tools.

### Research Question

In what ways can AI personalize AAC to support accurate expression for individuals with communication disabilities and reduce caregiver burden?

---

### Methodology

The research was conducted through a multi-stage process involving instrument development, participant recruitment, pilot testing, and data analysis.

- **Participants**: Data was collected from 21 caregivers, resulting in 20 usable survey responses. 16 of these caregivers also participated in a follow-up interview.
- **Instrument**: An initial 57-item survey was developed based on existing AAC usage and needs research. After initial analysis, a second iteration with 76 items was created for ongoing data collection.
- **Data Analysis**: Quantitative data was analyzed using Spearman's correlation coefficient to identify relationships between variables. Qualitative data was analyzed to identify key themes and caregiver frustrations.

### Key Findings

#### Qualitative Themes

- **Core Caregiver Frustrations**: The primary challenges reported by caregivers include children's inflexibility and rigid adherence to routines, difficulty understanding abstract concepts, and managing emotional meltdowns.
- **Low AAC Adoption**: Only ~20% of participants currently use AAC. The main reasons for low adoption are concerns that AAC might inhibit verbal speech development, as well as the complexity, cost, and lack of professional guidance associated with the devices.
- **Current Successful Strategies**: Caregivers have found success with non-tech strategies such as visualizing schedules, simplifying language, and leveraging a child's special interests (e.g., cartoon characters).

#### Correlations of Interest

* Caregivers who were more satisfied with their current communication methods were also more concerned that AI would make AAC systems too complex.
* Caregivers who were less satisfied with their current methods were more willing to share video and audio data to train an AI model.
* Caregivers whose children struggled more to initiate conversations were more likely to trust AI to provide support.

### Identified User Pain Point

Children with autism struggle to express abstract needs; caregivers are left guessing, and existing AAC tools don't adapt to time, routines, or emotions.
